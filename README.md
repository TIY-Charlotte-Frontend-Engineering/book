# Frontend engineering @ The Iron Yard
The goal of this book is to introduce fundamental concepts to new frontend engineering students. Most of the content of this book is pulled in from other places on the web, though there are some custom bits as well. More information on all of these topics is abundant online and we encourage you to dig deeper.

The next few weeks will mark what will hopefully be a mind-blowing adventure that'll be both interesting and practical. In addition to learning the technical topics covered in this book, it's even more important that you begin to cultivate the mindset of an engineer and the desire to learn. Nothing will serve you better along this path in the future than those two things.

## Using this material
This material will be most useful if you work through it *before the first day of class.* You'll get much more experience with all of these technologies throughout the course but you'll save yourself a lot of brain strain if you start to wrap your head around them now.

Each section has a list of things you should do to learn the fundamentals for each topic, as well as some resources for diving deeper. If these materials don't cut it for you, explore around online for other content that may cover the same topics. Feel free to ask questions or share links on your class's Slack channel.

## Promises and expectations
The [Code School Manifesto](http://masondesu.github.io/code-school-manifesto/) describes both the promises we make and what we expect in return. This course will be difficult for most; it's intended to push you and stretch your brain in potentially unfamiliar ways.
