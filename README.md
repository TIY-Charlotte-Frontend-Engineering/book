# Frontend engineering @ The Iron Yard
The goal of this book is to provide a structure for great content across the web that will be useful to Iron Yard students. Most of the content of this book is pulled in from other places on the web, though there are some custom bits as well as links to class material interspersed throughout.

The next few weeks will mark what will hopefully be a mind-blowing adventure that'll be useful to you for a long time. In addition to learning the technical topics covered in this book, it's even more important that you begin to cultivate the mindset of an engineer and the willingness (or even desire!) to learn. Nothing will serve you better along this path in the future than those two things.

## Promises and expectations
The [Code School Manifesto](http://masondesu.github.io/code-school-manifesto/) describes both the promises we make and what we expect in return. This course will be difficult for most; it's intended to push you and stretch your brain in potentially unfamiliar ways.

The majority of this book covers the fundamental technical topics required to be a successful frontend software engineer. The [**Prework**](content/2-prework.md) section describes the only prior knowledge that's expected prior to the beginning of the course, and is important to understand prior to starting class. The pace of the course is very fast and it's important that we don't spend too much time on prework topics in class.
