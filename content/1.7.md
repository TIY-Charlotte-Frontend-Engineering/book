# Typing skills
Coding necessarily involves a lot of typing, including a lot of weird characters that you don't normally type in everyday life. You'll find yourself to be much more productive if your typing can keep up with your thinking, so making sure you're comfortable with a keyboard is important.

Some people also have trouble keeping their speed up with funky characters like `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`, and `@` floating around like they do. [typing.io](https://typing.io/) provides free coding-specific typing practice if you feel so inclined.
