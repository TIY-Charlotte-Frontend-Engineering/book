# The command line
Though it might not feel like it at first, mastery of command line basics is essential for any developer (and extremely useful for non-devs) and will make your life much easier. The command line is just another way of giving your computer instructions (like clicking on an icon) but generally allows for much greater flexibility than graphical interfaces do. The command line is called **Terminal** on Macs.

The command line can be daunting for many people when getting started, but it's absolutely essential. You will love it once it clicks.
