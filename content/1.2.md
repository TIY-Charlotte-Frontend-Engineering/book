# Setting up your environment
For the purposes of this course, we'll standardize on a specific configuration (Mac OS) for simplicity, but there are usually alternatives that may work better for you after the course wraps up. Having a comfortable and productive set of tools to help you along is something that can be incredibly valuable. Less time spent dealing with janky software means more time making great things!

The tools we'll standardize on here are:

  1. **Mac OS**. You'll need to bring a Macbook to class, and it should have all software updated applied.
  2. [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com) for text editing. It's a simple and powerful text editor that is available for free online and designed specifically for frontend development.
  3. [**Google Chrome**](http://www.google.com/chrome/) for running our masterpieces. Chrome comes with some really valuable built-in developer tools that we'll want to take advantage of.
  4. [**Git**](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for managing and sharing code.
  5. [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/stable/) for some more advanced out-of-browser Javascript development we'll do later in the course.
  6. [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) for classroom communication. I'd recommend installing the desktop version instead of using the web client so that you can receive notifications if need to reach you.

You should install all of these prior to the beginning of class.

## Your computer
Your computer is your companion when it comes to development, and you should figure out how to make it work well for you beyond the specific tools we're standardizing on.

It's important that you have your computer updated and be familiar with how to use it so you don't get hung up trying to do fairly basic tasks like maximizing a window (something that may be strange if you come from a Windows background). Read up on [Mac OS basics](https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/) if you're unfamiliar, and make sure you have [upgraded to the latest version of Mac OS](http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/). Use your computer for everyday tasks prior to the start of class if at all possible to get comfortable with it.

## Accounts and software
You should also set up an account on [**Github**](https://github.com/), which will be a critical tool for your time at the Iron Yard and beyond, especially when you're working with others or building a public portfolio. We'll cover [Git and Github](content/1.6.md) later in the prework section and will spend time during the course on this as well.

You should also set up an account on [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) for communicating with your instructor, campus director, and classmates. Our class will primarily operate out of the **frontend-js** channel.
