# Git and Github
Many moons ago, programming was plagued with issues related to maintaining a history of code revisions. This manifested itself in many annoying ways:

  - Collaborating with others could be quite difficult, especially if you wanted to be able to work independently on the same project and then combine your changes later.
  - If someone made a change that had a negative impact on the code quality (caused crashes, slowed things down, etc), tracking that specific change down and undoing it could be pretty burdensome.
  - Backing up your code in multiple places [in case something goes wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) was a headache.
  
"Version control" systems are the modern solution to most of these problems and has perhaps changed the development landscape more than any other recent innovation. Here's an [awesome article](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/mac/basics/why-use-version-control) describing the problems that version control systems help us confront.

**Git** is the version control system that we'll be using in our course and is very popular today in the open source world. It's a great system to learn due to it's current popularity and most concepts will translate over to other version control systems quite well. The official Git book briefly describes the [evolution of version control systems](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) over time, though the description is somewhat technical. The [whole book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is actually very good if you're interested in becoming a Git ninja, though a full read of the book will be far more detailed than what you'll need for now.

You should read over this [simplified guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) to get the gist of how to use Git from the console. Check out the relevent sections in the book (linked above) if you want to find out more about any particular command. We'll spend some time covering critical commands in class as well. 

## Github
Github is a very popular website that hosts Git repositories and is an excellent collaboration tool. We'll be using Github regularly in class so you should [create an account](https://github.com/), set your first name, last name, and profile pictures, and then send me your username so that I can add you to our class organization. You'll be able to easily find other students' work there, as well as content and examples presented in class. 

You should think of Github as a collaboration tool as well as a public showcase for your work, and the changes you submit as an important form of communication. Check out [this article](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write effective commit messages, which your teammates and future coworkers will thank you for if you build good habits from the start.

## Things to do
- Make sure you've got a Github account; create one if not.
- Create a new repository and practice run through [Github's Try Git exercises](https://try.github.io).
- Try creating a new repository on Github, cloning it to your computer, adding a file to it, and commiting + pushing your changes back to Github.
