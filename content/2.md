# HTML + CSS
HTML and CSS are the bread and butter of the web. Every website you've ever seen uses HTML and CSS to describe and present information to users.

HTML is the language we use to describe the *structure* of a web page: the content (text, images, navigational elements, lists, titles, paragraphs, links, etc) and how the content relates to each other. CSS describes the presentation of that content: colors, layouts, spacing, fonts, etc.

In a way, using HTML and CSS are sort of like vocabulary tests; there are a number of different tags and properties that have specific names. Each section will call out some examples; don't worry about learning all of them but do try to get a sense of the types of tags that exist. Your vocabulary will expand as you get more experience designing layouts.
