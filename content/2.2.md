# CSS
The web is an extremely flexible platform that can help us display almost any sort of information in any way we want to. CSS, or "cascading style sheets," is how we define *how* information should be presented (vs HTML, which defines *what* information should be presented). Almost all web pages will use some combination of HTML and CSS to create the view available to their users. 

Start things off by going through the HTML + CSS [CodeAcademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) to build fundamentals.

**Pro tip**: Google is *definitely* your friend with CSS. There are far more CSS properties than HTML tags, and some of them take some getting used to. Expect to refine your CSS knowledge over time. Some very common CSS properties include:

  - Positioning and size (`position`, `height`, `width`, `float`, etc)
  - Spacing (`margin`, `padding`, `line-height`)
  - Fonts (`font-family`, `font-size`, and other `font-` properties)
  - Colors (`color`, `background-color`, `border-color`, `opacity`)
  
A full list of CSS properties is maintained [here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/), and a given project will likely require more than just the properties listed above, though specifics will depend on what you're trying to do.

**Another pro tip**: you can temporarily manipulate CSS in [Chrome's developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) as well as similar tools in other browsers. This is a great way to try out tweaking values until you get the look you want. Just make sure to copy whatever values you want into a permanent home (CSS file) before you refresh or close the tab.

"More CSS!", you say? Here are some other great CSS and design-related things on the internet.

- Mozilla (maker of the Firefox browser) has *incredible* documentation on all things web. Their [CSS site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is one of the best references out there.
