# Javascript
Javascript is a fascinating programming language that's become popular due in large part to it's widespread support in web browsers. It is, for all practical purposes, the programming language of the web.

While HTML and CSS are specialized languages that allow you to perform specific tasks, Javascript is a general-purpose programming language that is capable of expressing far more. The language is also evolving fairly rapidly (at least, 'rapidly' for a programming language) and a new version of Javascript, widely known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6), is on it's way to a browser near you.

Another key feature of the Javascript ecosystem is it's community. It's accessibility has made it very popular with beginners and experts alike, and developers have contributed [huge number of libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/) as well as hundreds of new questions and answers every day on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags).

## Big ideas
**Javascript is one of many languages that allow us to teach computers how to do things.** All languages have pros and cons; one of Javascript's biggest advantages is that it's the only general purpose language that's widely supported in all popular web browsers.

## Things to do
- You can practice writing Javascript on [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output) or by writing files on your own computer. JSBin may be the easiest place to start prior to class.
- [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a free, high-quality textbook on Javascript that provides a great overview of the language. It may be a bit dense if you've never programmed before but is worth taking a look at. We won't be using this textbook during class per se but keep it on hand in case you'd like an alternative explanation of a topic.
