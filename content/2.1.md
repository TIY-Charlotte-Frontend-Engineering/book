# HTML
HTML is referred to as a "markup language" and is what defines the structure of content in our web apps. This page, for example, is divided up into a title with a series of distinct paragraphs, each of which is distiguished to the web browser using HTML. Every website uses HTML, and it's absolutely fundamental to the way the web works today.

**Pro tip:** Google is really your best friend for learning (or remembering) HTML. There's an extraordinary amount of really great information out there. Understanding how to structure web pages and some of the most useful tags is important, and you can keep a link to a [cheat sheet](http://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/) around for more obscure tags. Some very common HTML tags include: 

  - Paragraphs (`p`)
  - Headers (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc)
  - Forms (`form`, `input`)
  - Images and graphics (`img`, `canvas`)
  - Lists (`ul`, `ol`, `li`)
  - Tables (`table`, `th`, `tr`, `td`)
  
Note that HTML defines *structure* and content, but does not affect how the elements themselves appear (fonts, colors, positions, etc). That's where [CSS](content/1.4.md) comes in. Work through the [CodeAcademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) on HTML and CSS if you're not familiar with them, and make sure you both get a sense of the difference between HTML and CSS, as well as get a feel for some of the most useful tags.
